# Smart-Vending-Machine
A smart vending machine offers four distinct products: P0, P1, P2, and P3,
each mapped to its respective selection button. Only one product can be
dispensed at a time. However, multiple buttons can be pressed simultaneously
(due to customer impatience or error).
 To ensure consistency, the vending machine follows a priority rule:
If multiple buttons are pressed, it always selects the product with the highest
priority.
Priority Order (highest to lowest): P0 > P1 > P2 > P3
